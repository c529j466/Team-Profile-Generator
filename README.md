# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description

For this project, I was tasked with creating a generator that creates a team page based on a user's responses to command line prompts. I also needed to create a series of tests, making sure the functionality of the classes I created, functioned how I wanted it to. The project also needed the functionality of multiple employees being able to be added, links to employee githubs, emails for employees with the ability to populate their email address to the users default 'to-line' in their email, and an html file to be generated for the team page. The page functioned in that when a user opens their terminal to install the npm packages and then starts the generator, a series of questions will be asked through the command line, and based on the user's answers to those questions, an html file is created with their responses. My motivation to complete this project was to better understand how to apply classes and new classes to make code more dry. I also was motivated to learn more about recursion of functions, template literal functionality, and testing for code.

## Installation

To install the Team generator, a user would need to download the files from the repository to their local system, run npm install to pull in the needed dependencies for the generator, and then run npm start to begin the prompts for the html contents.

## Credits

I recieved help on this project from my instructors, Henery Winget and Chris Sinlasath. I also received help on the recursion functionality from my tutor, Andres Jimenez.
